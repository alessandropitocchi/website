# 🚀 I Just Deployed My First Website on AWS with CI/CD! 🎉

Over the past few days, I’ve been working on a project to host a static website on AWS, manage it with Terraform, and fully automate deployments with GitHub Actions. My goal? Learn, challenge myself, and get hands-on experience with Cloud and DevOps.

## 🔹 How I Structured the Project 🛠
💡 I wanted to approach this like a real DevOps project, so I divided it into phases to gradually reach the final solution.

### 📝 Phase 1: Setting Up the Repository and Website
✅ Created a GitHub repository to manage the code
✅ Built a basic website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
✅ Registered the domain alessandropitocchi.it and decided to host it on AWS S3

🔹 Goal: Have a clean repository and a ready-to-use domain.

### 🛠 Phase 2: Configuring Infrastructure with Terraform
✅ Wrote the initial Terraform scripts to create S3, CloudFront, and Route 53
✅ Set up an SSL certificate with AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) (this is where the first headaches started 😅)
✅ Tested the deployment and fixed several syntax and configuration errors

🔹 Biggest issue: Validating the SSL certificate via DNS. I had to dig deep into how CNAME records work in Route 53 to successfully validate the certificate with Terraform.

### 📂 Phase 3: Manually Uploading Files to Test Everything
✅ After configuring the infrastructure with Terraform, I manually uploaded the website files to the S3 bucket
✅ Tested the website by accessing the domain
✅ Found out that CloudFront was still serving the old files… Cache issues!

🔹 Solution: Manually invalidate the CloudFront cache to ensure updated files were being served.

### ⚙️ Phase 4: Setting Up CI/CD with GitHub Actions
✅ Created a GitHub Actions pipeline that:

Runs linters to check HTML, CSS, and JavaScript quality
Uploads files to S3 automatically
Invalidates CloudFront cache to instantly reflect changes
✅ Now, every time I push to GitHub, the website updates automatically! 🚀

🔹 Main challenge: Understanding how to properly configure GitHub Actions with AWS and set up the IAM permissions and secrets correctly.

## 🔹 Biggest Challenges 🚧
### 💀 SSL Certificate & Terraform
Terraform requires SSL certificates to be validated via Route 53. I ran into several configuration issues and had to wait for DNS propagation before everything worked.

### 🤯 CloudFront Caching Issues
Even after updating files in S3, CloudFront was still serving old versions. I realized I needed to manually invalidate the cache to reflect changes immediately.

### ⚙ Automating Deployments with GitHub Actions
It wasn't just "copy files"; I had to manage AWS IAM, permissions, and secrets. My first attempt at automating deployments... completely failed. 😅 After some debugging, it now works smoothly!

### 🌐 Domain Not Reaching the S3 Bucket Due to IPv6
At first, my domain couldn't reach the bucket because Route 53 AAAA (IPv6) records were causing issues with CloudFront.
🔹 Solution: I had to remove the AAAA records and keep only the A (IPv4) records in Route 53 to make the domain resolution work correctly!

## 🔹 Why Did I Do This?
To learn! I know this isn't a perfect setup, and there are definitely optimizations I could make. Any feedback, criticism, or advice is more than welcome! 🙌

If you have suggestions on how to improve this setup, avoid common pitfalls, or make the pipeline more efficient, I’m all ears!
